For a description of how schema files are versioned, see link:../VERSIONING{ext-relative}[main directory].

=== This version (revisions)
- 2018-10-30: Initial release
- 2019-02-28: Switch to different rendering engine, only stylistic changes

=== Version 4.3.1 from 4.3.0
- 2018-10-30: Due to a change of the geographic boundaries for a WIB   in Iowa, the shape files need to be updated.
- Adjust the "supersedes" definition to correctly reference the prior version.

=== Version 4.3.0 from 4.2.0
- Changed the format of the version.txt file. This does not affect data files, but it does affect the metadata, and thus requires an increase in the minor version.
- Changed the description of the download locations of the QWI files, as part of the "naming" schema.
