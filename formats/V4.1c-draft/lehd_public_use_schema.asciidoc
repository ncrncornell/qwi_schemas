==============================================
This specification is draft. Feedback is welcome. Please write us at link:mailto:ces.qwi.feedback@census.gov?subject=LEHD_Schema_draft[ces.qwi.feedback@census.gov].
==============================================
	


The public-use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program, including the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)
and Job-to-Job Flows (J2J), are available for download with the following data schema.
These data are available as Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files through the LEHD websiteâ€™s Data page at
http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/ .

This document describes the data schema for LEHD files. For each variable,
a set of allowable values is defined. Definitions are provided as CSV files,
with header variable definitions. The naming conventions of the data files is documented in link:lehd_csv_naming.html[]. Changes relative to the original v4.0 version are listed <<changes,at the end>>.


Basic Schema
------------
Each file is structured as a CSV file. The first columns contain <<identifiers>>, subsequent columns contain <<indicators>>, followed by <<statusflags,status flags>>.

=== Generic structure

[width="30%",format="csv",cols="<2",options="header"]
|===================================================
Column name
[ Identifier1 ]
[ Identifier2 ]
[ Identifier3 ]
[ ... ]
[ Indicator 1 ]
[ Indicator 2 ]
[ Indicator 3 ]
[ ... ]
[ Status Flag 1 ]
[ Status Flag 2 ]
[ Status Flag 3 ]
[ ... ]
|===================================================

Note: A full list of indicators for each type of file are shown below in the <<indicators,Indicators>> section.
While all indicators are included in the CSV files, only the requested indicators
will be included in data outputs from the LED Extraction Tool.

<<<

=== [[identifiers]]Identifiers
Records, unless otherwise noted, are parts of time-series data. Unique record identifiers are noted below, by file type.
Identifiers without the year and quarter component can be considered a series identifier.

==== Mapping for Identifiers
( link:lehd_mapping_identifiers.csv[] )

Each of the released files has a set of variables uniquely identifying records ('Identifiers'). The table below relates the set of identifier specifications
to the released files. The actual CSV files containing the identifiers for each set are listed after this table. Each identifier can take on a specified list of values, documented in the section on <<catvars,Categorical Variables>>.

=== [[indicators]]Indicators
The following tables and associated mapping files
list the indicators available on each file.  The ''Indicator Variable'' is the short name of the variable on the CSV files, suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of statistical applications. When given, the ''Alternate name'' may appear in related documentation and articles. The ''Status Flag'' is used to indicate publication or data quality status (see <<statusflags,Status Flags>>). The ''Indicator Name'' is a more verbose description of the indicator.

=== [[vmeasures]]Variability measures
The following tables and associated mapping files
list the variability measures available on each file.  The ''Variability Measure'' is the short name of the variable on the CSV files,
suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of statistical applications. When given, the ''Alternate Name'' may appear in related documentation and articles.
The ''Variable Name'' is a more verbose description of the variability measure.

Six variability measures are published:

* Total variability, prefixed by vt_
* Standard error, prefixed by st_, and computed as the square root of Total Variability
* Between-implicate variability, prefixed by vb_
* Average within-implicate variability, prefixed by vw_
* Degrees of freedom, prefixed by df_
* Missingness ratio, prefixed by mr_

A missing variability measure indicates a structural zero in the corresponding indicator. This is currently not associated with a flag.

//Not all indicators have associated variability measures. For more details, see the following document TBD.

Geography labels are provided in separate files by state. Note that cross-state CBSA will have
state-specific parts, and thus will appear in multiple files.
A separate link:label_fipsnum.csv[label_fipsnum.csv] contains values and labels
for all entities of geo_level 'n' or 's', and is a summary of separately available files.

|===================================================

==== Detailed state and substate level values

For a full listing of all valid geography codes (except for WIA codes), see http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html.
Note about geography codes: Four types of geography codes are represented with this field. Each geography
has its own code structure.

- State is the 2-digit http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_fips.htm[FIPS] code. 'us' stands for national scope.
- County is the 5-digit FIPS code.
- Metropolitan/Micropolitan codes are constructed from the 2-digit state FIPS code and the 5-digit http://www.census.gov/population/metro/[CBSA] code provided by the Census Bureauâ€™s Geography Division.
** In the QWI, the metropolitan/micropolitan areas are the state parts of the full CBSA areas.
** In J2J, tabulations are based on the complete metropolitan/micropolitan area.
- The WIA code is constructed from the 2-digit state FIPS code and the 6-digit WIA identifier provided by LED State Partners.

The 2014 vintage of Census TIGER geography is used for all tabulations as of the R2014Q3 release.

For convenience, a composite file containing all geocodes is available as
link:label_geography_all.csv[].

=== Aggregation level
( link:label_agg_level.csv[] )

Measures within the J2J and QWI data products are tabulated on many different dimensions, including demographic characteristics, geography, industry, and other firm characteristics. For Origin-Destination (O-D) tables, characteristics of the origin and destination firm can be tabulated separately.  Every tabulation level is assigned a unique aggregation index, represented by the agg_level variable. This index starts from 1, representing a national level grand total (all industries, workers, etc.), and progresses through different combinations of characteristics. There are gaps in the progression to leave space for aggregation levels that may be included in future data releases.

*agg_level* is currently  reported only for  J2J data products.


The following variables are included in the link:label_agg_level.csv[agg_level.csv]   file:

- agg_level - index representing level of aggregation reported on a given record.
- worker_char - demographic (worker) characteristics reported on record.
- firm_char - firm characteristics reported on record. In origin-destination  tabulations, these will be the characteristics of the destination firm.
- firm_orig_char - characteristics of origin firm reported on record (O-D tabulations, only)
- j2j - Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J counts tables
- j2jr - Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J rates tables
- j2jod - Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J O-D  tables.
- qwi - Flag: Aggregation level available on QWI (placeholder for future integration)

The characteristics available on an aggregation level are repeated using a series of flags following the standard schema:

- <<geo_level,geo_level>> - geographic level of table, as per 2.13.1.
- <<ind_level,ind_level>> - industry level of table, as per 2.12.1.
- by_ variables - flags indicating other dimensions reported, including ownership, demographics, firm age and size.

These flags will be expanded to include origin characteristics in a later release. A shortened representation of the file is provided below, the complete file is available in the link above.

Note: Currently, the J2J tables only contain status flags '-1'  and '1.' Status flags with values 10 or above only appear in online applications, not in CSV files.
