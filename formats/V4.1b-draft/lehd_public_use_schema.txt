            This document is not an official Census Bureau publication. It is
[Important] compiled from publicly accessible information by Lars Vilhuber
            (Labor_Dynamics_Institute,_Cornell_University). Feedback is
            welcome. Please write us at lars.vilhuber@cornell.edu.
The public-use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program,
including the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) and Job-to-Job Flows (J2J),
are available for download with the following data schema. These data are
available as Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files through the LEHD website’s Data
page at http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/ .
This document describes the data schema for LEHD files. For each variable, a
set of allowable values is defined. Definitions are provided as CSV files, with
header variable definitions. The naming conventions of the data files is
documented in lehd_csv_naming.html. Changes relative to the original v4.0
version are listed at_the_end.
***** 1. Basic Schema *****
Each file is structured as a CSV file. The first columns contain [identifiers],
subsequent columns contain [indicators], followed by status_flags.
**** 1.1. Generic structure ****
Column name
[ Identifier1 ]
[ Identifier2 ]
[ Identifier3 ]
[ … ]
[ Indicator 1 ]
[ Indicator 2 ]
[ Indicator 3 ]
[ … ]
[ Status Flag 1 ]

Note: A full list of indicators for each type of file are shown below in the
Indicators section. While all indicators are included in the CSV files, only
the requested indicators will be included in data outputs from the LED
Extraction Tool.
1.2. Identifiers
Records, unless otherwise noted, are parts of time-series data. Unique record
identifiers are noted below, by file type. Identifiers without the year and
quarter component can be considered a series identifier.
*** 1.2.1. Mapping for Identifiers ***
( lehd_mapping_identifiers.csv )
Each of the released files has a set of variables uniquely identifying records
(Identifiers). The table below relates the set of identifier specifications to
the released files. The actual CSV files containing the identifiers for each
set are listed after this table. Each identifier can take on a specified list
of values, documented in the section on Categorical_Variables.

1.3. Indicators
The following tables and associated mapping files list the indicators available
on each file. The 'Indicator Variable' is the short name of the variable on the
CSV files, suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of statistical
applications. When given, the 'Alternate name' may appear in related
documentation and articles. The 'Status Flag' is used to indicate publication
or data quality status (see Status_Flags). The 'Indicator Name' is a more
verbose description of the indicator.

1.4. Variability measures
The following tables and associated mapping files list the variability measures
available on each file. The 'Variability Measure' is the short name of the
variable on the CSV files, suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of
statistical applications. When given, the 'Alternate Name' may appear in
related documentation and articles. The 'Variable Name' is a more verbose
description of the variability measure.
Six variability measures are published:
    * Total variability, prefixed by vt_
    * Standard error, prefixed by st_, and computed as the square root of Total
      Variability
    * Between-implicate variability, prefixed by vb_
    * Average within-implicate variability, prefixed by vw_
    * Degrees of freedom, prefixed by df_
    * Missingness ratio, prefixed by mr_
A missing variability measure indicates a structural zero in the corresponding
indicator. This is currently not associated with a flag.

Note: A full list of indicators for each type of file are shown in the
Indicators section. In the tables below, only a sample of variability measures
are printed, but the complete list is available in the linked CSV schema files.

Geography labels are provided in separate files by state. Note that cross-state
CBSA will have state-specific parts, and thus will appear in multiple files. A
separate label_fipsnum.csv contains values and labels for all entities of
geo_level n or s, and is a summary of separately available files.

For a full listing of all valid geography codes (except for WIA codes), see
http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html. Note about geography
codes: Four types of geography codes are represented with this field. Each
geography has its own code structure.
    * State is the 2-digit FIPS code.
    * County is the 5-digit FIPS code.
    * Metropolitan/Micropolitan codes are constructed from the 2-digit state
      FIPS code and the 5-digit CBSA code provided by the Census Bureau’s
      Geography Division.
          o In the QWI, the metropolitan/micropolitan areas are the state parts
            of the full CBSA areas.
          o In J2J, tabulations are based on the complete metropolitan/
            micropolitan area.
    * The WIA code is constructed from the 2-digit state FIPS code and the 6-
      digit WIA identifier provided by LED State Partners.
The 2014 vintage of Census TIGER geography is used for all tabulations as of
the 2014Q3 release.

**** 2.14. Aggregation level ****
( label_agg_level.csv )
Measures within the J2J and QWI data products are tabulated on many different
dimensions, including demographic characteristics, geography, industry, and
other firm characteristics. These different tabulations are each assigned a
unique aggregation level, represented by the agg_level variable. This index
starts from 1, representing a national level grand total (all industries,
workers, etc.), and progresses through different combinations of
characteristics. There are gaps in the progression to leave space for
aggregation levels that may be included in future data releases. agg_level is
currently reported only for J2J data products.
The following variables are included in the agg_level.csv file:
    * agg_level - index representing level of aggregation reported on a given
      record.
    * worker_char - demographic (worker) characteristics reported on record.
    * firm_char - firm/establishment characteristics reported on record. In
      origin-destination tabulations, these will be the characteristics of the
      destination firm.
    * firm_orig_char - firm/establishment characteristics of origin firm
      reported on record (origin-destination tabulations, only)
    * j2j, j2jr, qwi - flags indicating which tabulations are included with
      each data product. The variable will be filled in with 1 if the data
      product is available on listed dimensions.
The characteristics available on an aggregation level are repeated using a
series of flags following the standard schema:
    * geo_level - geographic level of table, as per 2.13.1.
    * ind_level - industry level of table, as per 2.12.1.
    * by_ variables - flags indicating other dimensions reported, including
      ownership, demographics, firm age and size.
These flags will be expanded to include origin characteristics in a later
release.

3. Status flags
( label_flags.csv )
Each status flag in the tables above contains one of the following valid
values. The values and their interpretation are listed in the table below.
            Important
[Important] Note: Currently, the J2J tables only contain status flags -1 and 1.
            Status flags with values 10 or above only appear in online
            applications, not in CSV files.
flag label
 -2  no data available in this category for this quarter
 -1  data not available to compute this estimate
  1  OK
  5  Value suppressed because it does not meet US Census Bureau publication
     standards.
  6  Value calculated from other released measures - no significant distortion
  7  Value calculated from other released measures - some of which have
     significantly distorted data
  9  Data significantly distorted - fuzzed value released
 10  Aggregate of cells - no significant distortion
 11  Aggregate of cells not released because component cells do not meet U.S.
     Census Bureau publication standards
 12  Aggregate of cells - some of which have significantly distorted data
4.  Changes
**** 4.1. This version from previous releases of this document ****
    * 2015-02-25: corrected flag values
    * 2015-02-25: documents are now identified by date, not revision
