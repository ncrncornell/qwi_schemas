==============================================


Purpose
-------
The public-use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program, including the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)
and Job-to-Job Flows (J2J), are available for download with the following data schema.
These data are available as Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files through the LEHD websiteâ€™s Data page at
http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/ and through LED Extraction Tool at http://ledextract.ces.census.gov/.

This document describes the file naming schema for LEHD-provided CSV files. The contents (schema) are described in  link:lehd_public_use_schema.html[].

Extends
-------
This version extends v4.0. Any file compliant with LEHD or QWI Schema v4.0 will also be compliant with this schema.

Supersedes
----------
For the specified files, this is the first schema.


Basic Schema
------------

All files are preceded by a file type definition, followed by additional information on the aggregation level of the file, or
some other identifier.

-------------------
[TYPE]_[DETAILS].csv
-------------------

=== QWIPU from the LED Extraction Tool
CSV files downloaded through the  LED Extraction Tool at http://ledextract.ces.census.gov/ follow the following naming convention:
------------------------------------
[type]_[id].csv
------------------------------------
where +[id]+ is the Request ID (a unique string of characters) generated every time Submit Request'' is clicked. The ID references each query submission made to the database.

=== Other files
Full CSV files downloaded from the LEHD website at http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data follow the following naming convention:
--------------------------------
[type]_[geohi]_[demo]_[fas]_[geocat]_[indcat]_[ownercat]_[sa]
--------------------------------
where each component is described in more detail below. Schema files detailing legal values for each component can be downloaded from this website.
