[IMPORTANT]
.Important
==============================================
This document is not an official Census Bureau publication. It is compiled from publicly accessible information
by Lars Vilhuber (http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/ldi/[Labor Dynamics Institute, Cornell University]).
Feedback is welcome. Please write us at
link:mailto:lars.vilhuber@cornell.edu?subject=LEHD_Schema_v4[lars.vilhuber@cornell.edu].
==============================================
	

Purpose
-------
The public-use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program, including the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)
and Job-to-Job Flows (J2J), are available for download with the following data schema.
These data are available as Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files through the LEHD websiteâ€™s Data page at
http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/ and through LED Extraction Tool at http://ledextract.ces.census.gov/.

This document describes the data schema for LEHD files. LEHD-provided SHP files are separately described in link:lehd_shapefiles{ext-relative}[]. For each variable,
a set of allowable values is defined. Definitions are provided as CSV files,
with header variable definitions.  Changes relative to the original v4.0 version are listed <<changes,at the end>>.

File naming
-----------
The naming conventions of the data files is documented in link:lehd_csv_naming{ext-relative}[].

Extends
-------
This version reimplements some features from  V4.0. Many files compliant with LEHD or QWI Schema v4.0 will also be compliant with this schema, but compatibility is not guaranteed.

Supersedes
----------
This version supersedes V4.1.0, for files released as of R2017Q1.

Basic Schema
------------
Each data file is structured as a CSV file. The first columns contain <<identifiers>>, subsequent columns contain <<indicators>>, followed by <<statusflags,status flags>>.

=== Generic structure

[width="30%",format="csv",cols="<2",options="header"]
|===================================================
Column name
[ Identifier1 ]
[ Identifier2 ]
[ Identifier3 ]
[ ... ]
[ Indicator 1 ]
[ Indicator 2 ]
[ Indicator 3 ]
[ ... ]
[ Status Flag 1 ]
[ Status Flag 2 ]
[ Status Flag 3 ]
[ ... ]
|===================================================

Note: A full list of indicators for each type of file are shown below in the <<indicators,Indicators>> section.
While all indicators are included in the CSV files, only the requested indicators
will be included in data outputs from the LED Extraction Tool.

<<<

=== [[identifiers]]Identifiers
Records, unless otherwise noted, are parts of time-series data. Unique record identifiers are noted below, by file type.
Identifiers without the year and quarter component can be considered a series identifier.

==== Mapping for Identifiers
( link:lehd_mapping_identifiers.csv[] )

Each of the released files has a set of variables uniquely identifying records ('Identifiers'). The table below relates the set of identifier specifications
to the released files. The actual CSV files containing the identifiers for each set are listed after this table. Each identifier can take on a specified list of values, documented in the section on <<catvars,Categorical Variables>>.

=== [[indicators]]Indicators
The following tables and associated mapping files
list the indicators available on each file.  The ''Indicator Variable'' is the short name of the variable on the CSV files, suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of statistical applications. When given, the ''Alternate name'' may appear in related documentation and articles. The ''Status Flag'' is used to indicate publication or data quality status (see <<statusflags,Status Flags>>). The ''Indicator Name'' is a more verbose description of the indicator.

=== [[vmeasures]]Variability measures
The following tables and associated mapping files
list the variability measures available on each file.  The ''Variability Measure'' is the short name of the variable on the CSV files,
suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of statistical applications. When given, the ''Alternate Name'' may appear in related documentation and articles.
The ''Variable Name'' is a more verbose description of the variability measure.

Six variability measures are published:

* Total variability, prefixed by vt_
* Standard error, prefixed by st_, and computed as the square root of Total Variability
* Between-implicate variability, prefixed by vb_
* Average within-implicate variability, prefixed by vw_
* Degrees of freedom, prefixed by df_
* Missingness ratio, prefixed by mr_

A missing variability measure indicates a structural zero in the corresponding indicator. This is currently not associated with a flag.

//Not all indicators have associated variability measures. For more details, see the following document TBD.

=== Aggregation level
( link:label_agg_level.csv[] )

Measures within the J2J and QWI data products are tabulated on many different dimensions, including demographic characteristics, geography, industry, and other firm characteristics. For Origin-Destination (O-D) tables, characteristics of the origin and destination firm can be tabulated separately.  Every tabulation level is assigned a unique aggregation index, represented by the agg_level variable. This index starts from 1, representing a national level grand total (all industries, workers, etc.), and progresses through different combinations of characteristics. There are gaps in the progression to leave space for aggregation levels that may be included in future data releases.

*agg_level* is currently  reported only for  J2J data products.


The following variables are included in the link:label_agg_level.csv[label_agg_level.csv]   file:

[width="60%",format="csv",cols="<2,<5",options="header"]
|===================================================
include::variables_agg_level.csv[]
|===================================================


The characteristics available on an aggregation level are repeated using a series of flags following the standard schema:

- <<geolevel,geo_level>> - geographic level of table
- <<ind_level,ind_level>> - industry level of table
- by_ variables - flags indicating other dimensions reported, including ownership, demographics, firm age and size.

A shortened representation of the file is provided below, the complete file is available in the link above.
