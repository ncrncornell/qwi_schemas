            Important
            This document is not an official Census Bureau publication. It is
[Important] compiled from publicly accessible information by Lars Vilhuber
            (Labor_Dynamics_Institute,_Cornell_University). Feedback is
            welcome. Please write us at lars.vilhuber@cornell.edu.
***** 1. Purpose *****
The public-use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program,
including the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) and Job-to-Job Flows (J2J),
are available for download with the following data schema. These data are
available as Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files through the LEHD website’s Data
page at http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/ and through LED Extraction Tool at
http://ledextract.ces.census.gov/.
This document describes the data schema for LEHD files. LEHD-provided SHP files
are separately described in lehd_shapefiles.html. For each variable, a set of
allowable values is defined. Definitions are provided as CSV files, with header
variable definitions. Changes relative to the original v4.0 version are listed
at_the_end.
***** 2. File naming *****
The naming conventions of the data files is documented in lehd_csv_naming.html.
***** 3. Extends *****
This version reimplements some features from V4.0. Many files compliant with
LEHD or QWI Schema v4.0 will also be compliant with this schema, but
compatibility is not guaranteed.
***** 4. Supersedes *****
This version supersedes V4.1.0, for files released as of R2017Q1.
***** 5. Basic Schema *****
Each data file is structured as a CSV file. The first columns contain
[identifiers], subsequent columns contain [indicators], followed by status
flags.
**** 5.1. Generic structure ****
Column name
[ Identifier1 ]
[ Identifier2 ]
[ Identifier3 ]
[ … ]
[ Indicator 1 ]
[ Indicator 2 ]
[ Indicator 3 ]
[ … ]
[ Status Flag 1 ]
[ Status Flag 2 ]
[ Status Flag 3 ]
[ … ]
Note: A full list of indicators for each type of file are shown below in the
Indicators section. While all indicators are included in the CSV files, only
the requested indicators will be included in data outputs from the LED
Extraction Tool.
5.2. Identifiers
Records, unless otherwise noted, are parts of time-series data. Unique record
identifiers are noted below, by file type. Identifiers without the year and
quarter component can be considered a series identifier.
*** 5.2.1. Mapping for Identifiers ***
( lehd_mapping_identifiers.csv )
Each of the released files has a set of variables uniquely identifying records
(Identifiers). The table below relates the set of identifier specifications to
the released files. The actual CSV files containing the identifiers for each
set are listed after this table. Each identifier can take on a specified list
of values, documented in the section on Categorical_Variables.

5.3. Indicators
The following tables and associated mapping files list the indicators available
on each file. The 'Indicator Variable' is the short name of the variable on the
CSV files, suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of statistical
applications. When given, the 'Alternate name' may appear in related
documentation and articles. The 'Status Flag' is used to indicate publication
or data quality status (see Status_Flags). The 'Indicator Name' is a more
verbose description of the indicator.

5.4. Variability measures
The following tables and associated mapping files list the variability measures
available on each file. The 'Variability Measure' is the short name of the
variable on the CSV files, suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of
statistical applications. When given, the 'Alternate Name' may appear in
related documentation and articles. The 'Variable Name' is a more verbose
description of the variability measure.
Six variability measures are published:
    * Total variability, prefixed by vt_
    * Standard error, prefixed by st_, and computed as the square root of Total
      Variability
    * Between-implicate variability, prefixed by vb_
    * Average within-implicate variability, prefixed by vw_
    * Degrees of freedom, prefixed by df_
    * Missingness ratio, prefixed by mr_
A missing variability measure indicates a structural zero in the corresponding
indicator. This is currently not associated with a flag.

Note: A full list of indicators for each type of file are shown in the
Indicators section. In the tables below, only a sample of variability measures
are printed, but the complete list is available in the linked CSV schema files.

6.14.1.  Geographic levels
Geography labels for data files are provided in separate files, by scope. Each
file label_geograpy_SCOPE.csv may contain one or more types of records as
flagged by geo_level. For convenience, a composite file containing all geocodes
is available as label_geography.csv. The 2015 vintage of  Census_TIGER/Line
geography is used for all tabulations as of the R2015Q4 release.
Shapefiles are described in a separate_document.

**** 6.15. Aggregation level ****
( label_agg_level.csv )
Measures within the J2J and QWI data products are tabulated on many different
dimensions, including demographic characteristics, geography, industry, and
other firm characteristics. For Origin-Destination (O-D) tables,
characteristics of the origin and destination firm can be tabulated separately.
Every tabulation level is assigned a unique aggregation index, represented by
the agg_level variable. This index starts from 1, representing a national level
grand total (all industries, workers, etc.), and progresses through different
combinations of characteristics. There are gaps in the progression to leave
space for aggregation levels that may be included in future data releases.
agg_level is currently reported only for J2J data products.
The following variables are included in the label_agg_level.csv file:
Variable       Description
agg_level      index representing level of aggregation reported on a given
               record
worker_char    demographic (worker) characteristics reported on record
firm_char      firm characteristics reported on record. These will be the
               characteristics of the destination firm in O-D tabulations
firm_orig_char characteristics of origin firm reported on record (O-
               D tabulations only)
j2j            Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J counts tables
j2jr           Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J rates tables
j2jod          Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J O-D tables
qwi            Flag: Aggregation level available on QWI
The characteristics available on an aggregation level are repeated using a
series of flags following the standard schema:
    * geo_level - geographic level of table
    * ind_level - industry level of table
    * by_ variables - flags indicating other dimensions reported, including
      ownership, demographics, firm age and size.
A shortened representation of the file is provided below, the complete file is
available in the link above.

7. Status flags
( label_flags.csv )
Each status flag in the tables above contains one of the following valid
values. The values and their interpretation are listed in the table below.
            Important
[Important] Note: Currently, the J2J tables only contain status flags -1 and 1.
            Status flags with values 10 or above only appear in online
            applications, not in CSV files.
flag label
 -2  no data available in this category for this quarter
 -1  data not available to compute this estimate
  1  OK
  5  Value suppressed because it does not meet US Census Bureau publication
     standards.
  6  Value calculated from other released measures - no significant distortion
  7  Value calculated from other released measures - some of which have
     significantly distorted data
  9  Data significantly distorted - fuzzed value released
 10  Aggregate of cells - no significant distortion
 11  Aggregate of cells not released because component cells do not meet U.S.
     Census Bureau publication standards
 12  Aggregate of cells - some of which have significantly distorted data
