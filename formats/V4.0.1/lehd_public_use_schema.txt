            Important
            This document is not an official Census Bureau publication. It is
[Important] compiled from publicly accessible information by Lars Vilhuber
            (Labor_Dynamics_Institute,_Cornell_University). Feedback is
            welcome. Please write us at lars.vilhuber@cornell.edu.
The public-use Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) data from the Longitudinal
Employer-Household Dynamics Program are available for download with the
following data schema. These data are available as Comma-Separated Value (CSV)
files through the LEHD website’s Data page at http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/
and at an (occassional) mirror site at http://download.vrdc.cornell.edu/qwipu/.
This document describes the data schema for QWI files. For each variable, a set
of allowable values is defined. Definitions are provided as CSV files, with
header variable definitions. The naming conventions of the data files is
documented in lehd_csv_naming.html. Changes relative to the original v4.0
version are listed at_the_end.
***** 1. Basic Schema *****
Each file is structured as a CSV file. The first columns contain [identifiers],
subsequent columns contain [indicators], followed by status_flags.
**** 1.1. Generic structure ****
Column name
[ Identifier1 ]
[ Identifier2 ]
[ Identifier3 ]
[ … ]
[ Indicator 1 ]
[ Indicator 2 ]
[ Indicator 3 ]
[ … ]
[ Status Flag 1 ]
[ Status Flag 2 ]
[ Status Flag 3 ]
[ … ]
Note: A full list of indicators for each type of file are shown below in the
Indicators section. While all indicators are included in the CSV files, only
the requested indicators will be included in data outputs from the LED
Extraction Tool.
1.2. Identifiers
Records, unless otherwise noted, are parts of time-series data. Unique record
identifiers are noted below, by file type. Identifiers without the year and
quarter component can be considered a series identifier.

1.3. Indicators
The following tables and associated mapping files list the indicators available
on each file. The 'Indicator Variable' is the short name of the variable on the
CSV files, suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of statistical
applications. When given, the 'Alternate name' may appear in related
documentation and articles. The 'Status Flag' is used to indicate publication
or data quality status (see Status_Flags). The 'Indicator Name' is a more
verbose description of the indicator.

that cross-state CBSA will have state-specific parts, and thus will appear in
multiple files. A separate label_fipsnum.csv contains values and labels for all
entities of geo_level n or s, and is a summary of separately available files.

*** 2.12.3. Detailed state and substate level values ***
For a full listing of all valid geography codes (except for WIA codes), see
http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html. Note about geography
codes: Four types of geography codes are represented with this field. Each
geography has its own code structure.
    * State is the 2-digit FIPS code.
    * County is the 5-digit FIPS code.
    * Metropolitan/Micropolitan codes are constructed from the 2-digit state
      FIPS code and the 5-digit CBSA code provided by the Census Bureau’s
      Geography Division.
          o In the QWI, the metropolitan/micropolitan areas are the state parts
            of the full CBSA areas.
    * The WIA code is constructed from the 2-digit state FIPS code and the 6-
      digit WIA identifier provided by LED State Partners.
The 2014 vintage of Census TIGER geography is used for all tabulations as of
the 2014Q3 release.

3. Status flags
( label_flags.csv )
Each status flag in the tables above contains one of the following valid
values. The values and their interpretation are listed in the table below.
flag label
 -2  no data available in this category for this quarter
 -1  data not available to compute this estimate
  1  OK
  5  Value suppressed because it does not meet US Census Bureau publication
     standards.
  6  Value calculated from other released measures - no significant distortion
  7  Value calculated from other released measures - some of which have
     significantly distorted data
  9  Data significantly distorted - fuzzed value released
 10  Aggregate of cells - no significant distortion
 11  Aggregate of cells not released because component cells do not meet U.S.
     Census Bureau publication standards
 12  Aggregate of cells - some of which have significantly distorted data
4.  Changes
**** 4.1. Version 4.0.1 from 4.0 ****
    * 2015-02-24: removed obsolete flag values
