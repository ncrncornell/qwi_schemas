            Important
            This document is not an official Census Bureau publication. It is
[Important] compiled from publicly accessible information by Lars Vilhuber
            (Labor_Dynamics_Institute,_Cornell_University). Feedback is
            welcome. Please write us at lars.vilhuber@cornell.edu.
***** 1. Purpose *****
The public-use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program,
including the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) and Job-to-Job Flows (J2J),
are available for download with the following data schema. These data are
available as Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files through the LEHD websiteâ€™s Data
page at http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/ and through LED Extraction Tool at
http://ledextract.ces.census.gov/.
This document describes the file and directory naming schema for LEHD-provided
CSV files.
***** 2. Schema for Data File Contents *****
The contents (schema) for LEHD data files are described in
lehd_public_use_schema.html. The contents (schema) for shapefiles are described
in lehd_shapefiles.html.
***** 3. Extends *****
This version modifies a portion of the structure of the metadata. Many files
compliant with LEHD or QWI Schema v4.2 or lower will also be compliant with
this schema, but compatibility is not guaranteed.
***** 4. Supersedes *****
This version supersedes V4.2, for files released as of R2018Q3
***** 5. Basic Filename Schema *****
All files are preceded by a file type definition, followed by additional
information on the aggregation level of the file, or some other identifier.

**** 5.1. QWIPU from the LED Extraction Tool ****
Files downloaded through the LED Extraction Tool at http://
ledextract.ces.census.gov/ follow the following naming convention:
 [type]_[id].[EXT]
where [id] is the Request ID (a unique string of characters) generated every
time Submit Request'' is clicked. The ID references each query submission made
to the database.
5.2. Metadata for QWI and J2J data files (version.txt)
Metadata accompanies the data files, identifying provenance, geographic and
temporal coverage. These files follow the following naming convention:
version_[type].txt
where each name component is described in more detail below.
5.3. Metadata for J2JOD files
Because the origin-destination (J2JOD) data link two regions, we provide an
auxiliary file with the time range for which cells containing data for each
geographic pairing may appear in a data release. The reference region will
always be either the origin or the destination. These files follow the
following naming convention:
j2jod_[geography]_avail.csv
where each name component is described in more detail below.
6. Directory Paths
Downloadable data files are organized on the download server (at the time of
this writing: https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/) in directories organized as
follows:
 SERVER/data/[PRODUCT]/[RELEASE]/[GEOHI][ /[TYPE] ]/{files}
where [PRODUCT], [RELEASE], [GEOHI], and [TYPE] are each described below.
[TYPE] is optional.
7. Description of Naming Components
7.1. Release
A release is defined by the calendar year quarter when data production occurs.
It is thus generically constructed as
 R[YEAR]Q[QUARTER]
where [YEAR] is the 4-digit year and [QUARTER] the single-digit calendar year
quarter (1-4).

7.3. geohi
( naming_geohi.csv )
The geohi component in filenames is based on one of two possible code sets:
    * the lower-case alphabetic FIPS or postal state code based on FIPS_PUB_5-
      2 (see also label_stusps.csv for upper-case variants).
    * the numeric CBSA code corresponding to the metropolitan areas (see
      label_geography_metro.csv)
    * It is expanded to encompass additional codes denoting national coverage,
      or a collection of states.
For directories, files at the CBSA level are collected under a single metro
directory.

8.  Changes
For a description of how schema files are versioned, see main_directory.
**** 8.1. This version (revisions) ****
    * 2018-06-25: Initial release
**** 8.2. Version 4.3.0 from 4.2.0 ****
    * Changed the format of the version.txt file. This does not affect data
      files, but it does affect the metadata, and thus requires an increase in
      the minor version.
    * Changed the description of the download locations of the QWI files, as
      part of the "naming" schema.
