***** 1. Purpose *****
The public-use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program,
including the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) and Job-to-Job Flows (J2J),
are available for download with the following data schema. These data are
available as Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files through the LEHD website’s Data
page at http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/ and through LED Extraction Tool at
http://ledextract.ces.census.gov/.
This document describes the file naming schema for LEHD-provided CSV files. The
contents (schema) are described in lehd_public_use_schema.html.
***** 2. Extends *****
This version extends v4.0. Any file compliant with LEHD or QWI Schema v4.0 will
also be compliant with this schema.
***** 3. Supersedes *****
For the specified files, this is the first schema.
***** 4. Basic Schema *****
All files are preceded by a file type definition, followed by additional
information on the aggregation level of the file, or some other identifier.

where [id] is the Request ID (a unique string of characters) generated every
time Submit Request'' is clicked. The ID references each query submission made
to the database.
**** 4.2. Other files ****
Files downloaded from the LEHD website at http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data
follow the following naming convention:
[type]_[geohi]_[demo]_[fas]_[geocat]_[indcat]_[ownercat]_[sa].[EXT]
where each component is described in more detail below. Schema files detailing
legal values for each component can be downloaded from this website.
