            This document is not an official Census Bureau publication. It is
[Important] compiled from publicly accessible information by Lars Vilhuber
            (Labor_Dynamics_Institute,_Cornell_University). Feedback is

***** 1. Purpose *****
The public-use Job-to-Job Flows (J2J) data provided by the Longitudinal
Employer-Household Dynamics Program are accessible through the J2J_Explorer_
(beta). This document provides information on the schema used to format files
downloaded through that application.
***** 2. Additional information *****
The complete LEHD schema is documented in lehd_public_use_schema.html. LEHD-
provided SHP files are separately described in lehd_shapefiles.html. The naming
conventions of the data files is documented in lehd_csv_naming.html.
***** 3. Extends *****
This is the first version of the schema for the J2J Explorer (beta)
application.
***** 4. Supersedes *****
No prior version.
***** 5. Basic Schema *****
Each data file is structured as a CSV file. The first columns contain
[identifiers], subsequent columns contain [indicators], followed by status
flags.
**** 5.1. Generic structure ****

[ Identifier2 ]
[ Identifier3 ]
[ … ]
[ Indicator 1 ]
[ Indicator 2 ]

Note: The J2J Explorer (beta) provides the full set of J2J indicators in
addition to two composite Origin-Destination indicators. Files downloadable
through other means may be structured differently, please consult the complete
LEHD schema in lehd_public_use_schema.html.
5.2. Identifiers
Records, unless otherwise noted, are parts of time-series data. Unique record
identifiers are noted below, by file type. Identifiers without the year and
quarter component can be considered a series identifier.
*** 5.2.1. Mapping for Identifiers ***
( lehd_mapping_identifiers.csv )
Each of the released files has a set of variables uniquely identifying records
(Identifiers). The table below relates the set of identifier specifications to
the released files. The actual CSV files containing the identifiers for each
set are listed after this table. Each identifier can take on a specified list
of values, documented in the section on Categorical_Variables.

5.3. Indicators
The following tables and associated mapping files list the indicators available
on each file. The 'Indicator Variable' is the short name of the variable on the
CSV files, suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of statistical
applications. When given, the 'Alternate name' may appear in related
documentation and articles. The 'Status Flag' is used to indicate publication
or data quality status (see Status_Flags). The 'Indicator Name' is a more
verbose name for the indicator. The 'Description' provides a complete
description of the indicator. 'Units' identify the type of variable: counts,
rates, monetary amounts. 'Concept' classifies each indicator in a descriptive
category: employment, hire, separation, earnings, or flow. The 'Base' indicates
the denominator used to compute the statistic, and may be 1.

**** 6.15. Aggregation level ****
( label_agg_level.csv )
Measures within the J2J and QWI data products are tabulated on many different
dimensions, including demographic characteristics, geography, industry, and
other firm characteristics. For Origin-Destination (O-D) tables,
characteristics of the origin and destination firm can be tabulated separately.
Every tabulation level is assigned a unique aggregation index, represented by
the agg_level variable. This index starts from 1, representing a national level
grand total (all industries, workers, etc.), and progresses through different
combinations of characteristics. There are gaps in the progression to leave
space for aggregation levels that may be included in future data releases.
agg_level is currently reported only for J2J data products.
The following variables are included in the label_agg_level.csv file:
Variable       Description
agg_level      index representing level of aggregation reported on a given
               record
worker_char    demographic (worker) characteristics reported on record
firm_char      firm characteristics reported on record. These will be the
               characteristics of the destination firm in O-D tabulations
firm_orig_char characteristics of origin firm reported on record (O-
               D tabulations only)
j2j            Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J counts tables
j2jr           Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J rates tables
j2jod          Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J O-D tables
qwi            Flag: Aggregation level available on QWI
The characteristics available on an aggregation level are repeated using a
series of flags following the standard schema:
    * geo_level - geographic level of table
    * ind_level - industry level of table
    * by_ variables - flags indicating other dimensions reported, including
      ownership, demographics, firm age and size.
A shortened representation of the file is provided below, the complete file is
available in the link above.

7. Status flags
( label_flags.csv )
Each status flag in the tables above contains one of the following valid
values. The values and their interpretation are listed in the table below.
            Important
[Important] Note: Currently, the J2J tables only contain status flags -1 and 1.
            Status flags with values 10 or above only appear in online
            applications, not in CSV files.
