***** 1. Purpose *****
The public-use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program,
including the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) and Job-to-Job Flows (J2J),
are available for download with the following data schema. These data are
available as Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files through the LEHD website’s Data
page at http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/ and through LED Extraction Tool at
http://ledextract.ces.census.gov/.
This document describes the file naming schema for LEHD-provided CSV files.
***** 2. Schema for Data File Contents *****
The contents (schema) for LEHD data files are described in
lehd_public_use_schema.html. The contents (schema) for shapefiles are described
in lehd_shapefiles.html.
***** 3. Extends *****
This version reimplements some features from V4.0. Many files compliant with
LEHD or QWI Schema v4.0 will also be compliant with this schema, but
compatibility is not guaranteed.
***** 4. Supersedes *****
This version supersedes V4.0.5, for files released as of RXXXX.
***** 5. Basic Schema *****
All files are preceded by a file type definition, followed by additional
information on the aggregation level of the file, or some other identifier.
